# loan-default-analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive loan default analysis project. The dataset, provided by the company, was subjected to rigorous preprocessing using the NumPy library in Python. The goal was to transform the raw data, ensuring its readiness for subsequent advanced analytics and model training.
## Key Features

- **Utilized NumPy for data preprocessing**: Emphasized efficient array operations and mathematical functions.
- **Handled missing values, outliers, and potential discrepancies**: Ensured data consistency and reliability.
- **Delivered an optimized dataset**: Primed for data scientists to further refine and train predictive models.

## Objective

To provide a robust foundation for building accurate predictive models regarding loan defaults, ensuring the dataset is free from redundancies and errors.

## Usage

Ideal for data scientists and analysts looking to delve into loan default predictions. The preprocessed dataset serves as a starting point, reducing the time and effort required in initial data cleaning and wrangling.
